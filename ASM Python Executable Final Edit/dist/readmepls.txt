This is the executable file ASM console, everything other than the "view users in a team" option is working as normal. I'm not sure what broke it in the process,
for full functionality try the ASM frontend instead. Entering blank lines or incorrect inputs will also crash the exe, this is very much a demo. Use the frontend file
in IDLE for full functionality.

Example users for standard and admin accounts:

Admin:  Username = Admin
	Password = Admin

Standard: Username = User
	  Password = User
